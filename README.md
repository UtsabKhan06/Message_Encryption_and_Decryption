# Message_Encryption_and_Decryption
In this project I've created a tool which can easily encrypt plain text to cipher text and decrypt cipher text to plain text.

First you'll see in the home interface of the tool a space to write your plain text or cipher text. After that you have to enter the key in the "Enter key" section, the key is "1234". 

Then there are three buttons "Encrypt" , "Decrypt" and "Reset". 

If you want to convert plain text into cipher text click on the "Encrypt" button. If you want to decrypt the cipher text to plain the click on the "Decrypt" button.

And to clear everything that you've entered you can click on the reset button.
